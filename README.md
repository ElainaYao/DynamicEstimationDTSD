### DynamicEstimation_DiscreteTimeSurvivalData

Simulation codes for the paper "Dynamic estimation with random forests for discrete-time survival data"

- To obtain the accuracy values for each evaluation measurement, use predfunc.R
- To produce the boxplot for each model setup, use boxplotfunc.R
- To produce the main effects plots across all factors, use maineffectsfunc.R
- The example codes are given in run.R for reproducing the boxplots and main effects plots.
